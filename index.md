# Bioinformatics Summer School 2020

<!-- > - [UCLouvain](http://uclouvain.be/), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium -->
<!-- > - 6 - 10 July 2020 -->
<!-- > - [Louvain House](https://uclouvain.be/fr/louvainhouse) -->

This one-week intensive summer school in bioinformatics will focus on
**data analysis** and **high throughput biology**, with a special
focus on **R**/[**Bioconductor**](https://lgatto.github.io/about/) and
its application to a wide range of topics across bioinformatics and
computational biology. The course is intended for researchers who are
familiar with omics experimental technologies and their applications
in biology, have had some exposure with R, and who want to learn or
expand their bioinformatics skills.

The course will cover underlying theory and practical hands-on
exercises. At the end of the course, participants should be able to
run analysis workflows on their own omics data, adapt and combine
different tools and make informed choices about bioinformatics data
analysis strategies.

## Topics

- Bioconductor core technologies
- Elements of statistics and machine learning
- Omics data visualisation
- High throughput data processing
- RNA Seq data analysis (bulk and single cell)
- Quantitative proteomics
- Reproducible research and workflow authoring with R markdown

that you have a working wireless card, and that you have administrator
rights. Please follow these [software installation
instructions](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/BSS2020/installation.html)

**Prerequisites** Participants should be familiar to R and have some
experience of high throughput omics data. They should typicall feel at
ease with the suggested preliminary material by Martin Morgan below.

## Code of conduct

This code of conduct is developed based on the Bioc2019 conference
code of conduct.

BSS2020 is dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
- intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software
  preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of
participants in talks, workshops, poster sessions, social activities,
or online. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the event with no refund, at the discretion of the
organisers.

Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behaviour

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Making comments, to an audience or personally, that belittle or demean another person
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

- Aggressive or browbeating behaviour directed at someone during a public presentation
- Mocking or insulting another person’s intellect, work, perspective, or question/comment
- Making reference to someone’s gender, gender identity and
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
  body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attribute in the
  context of a scientific discussion
- Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome

#### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming
environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender
or expulsion from the event with no refund.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or
with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
event-related social activities. We think people should follow these
rules outside event activities too!  Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to
be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.

#### Personal Report

You can make a personal report with Laurent Gatto or Axelle
Loriot. You can contact them directly or by email at
`name.surname@uclouvain.be`.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your
report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about
what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support
you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone
who you are.

We value your attendance.
